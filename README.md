 Time for part 2!

&#x200B;

>Superiority Boundless-God Transcendent Ruling Omni-Eternity  
>  
>King Godverse dominates and controls all existence. It gains overwhelming powers by controlling all eternity against all dimensions and existence. In short, eternity and existence are absolutely controlled by King Godverse. It is inconceivably beyond the form of existence by not being limited to existence. He is infinite dimensional, Infinitiversal and exists in an eternal way in all dimensions. Everything and nothing depends on it and is under his absolute control. It is also beyond anything and beyond by destroying all existential and dimensional rules. He's existential/conceptual. Therefore it cannot be destroyed or invalidated. If this happens, all the rules of eternity and concept alike will be destroyed, and even the very bottom of all existence will be destroyed.  


  
So, "In short" seems to be the favorite phrase of author when describing something that is actually 5 times longer than the part that is being shortened. So, now adding onto the verse hierarchy we have "Infinitiverse". Is it INFINITI car brand universe? Works with Meta tech company universe.  
Also, what does "the very bottom of all existence" mean? Isn't 'bottom' defined relative to a planet (in this case, would be the center of the Earth? I don't think eternity and concept have any rules. So, like, this condition causes... nothing to happen other than there is now a hole at the center of Earth that probably gets filled in anyway and causes an earthquake or two. Why couldn't you just say that KGV dying causes an earthquake? But other than that one section, there's also a bunch of repetition going on.   


>Boundless-God Transcendent Omni-Embodiment  
>  
>King Godverse is the embodiment of Godverse, Reality, Eternity and etc. Anything you can think or not.  
>  
>  
>  
>Omnidimensional Embodiment:King Godverse is embody the infinite scale and scope of Totality. He is absolutely everything; every single infinite possibility and probability; every infinite reality, timeline, universe or dimension. He's embody of everything (un)imaginable, (im)possible, (non-)existent, (un)known, (un)knowable, (in)conceivable, (un)created, (un)discovered, (non-)fictional, (un)perceived, etc. He's is everything-in-one.  
>  
>Omnipotence Embodiment:King Godverse is his own omnipotent, supreme being and source of all things. He is the true master of all other powers, considered omnipotent. King Godverse is fully devoid of any potential weakness, the power can never be cut off or stolen, nor it's use can be disturbed, and backfired or turned against he.  
>  
>Box-Embodiment:King Godverse is the living Embodiment of the Box which contains everything even Absolutely Infinite himself. He have a imagination which is beyond anything and everything else it can Create even verses which is impossible to all Monotheistic Deitys.  
>  
>Eternity Embodiment:King Godverse is the embodiment of the eternal, so his any existence or self is eternal. He is an endless being, without end and beginning. He is completely eternal so he already has a great edge in Fiction. Having no beginning nor end, allowing him to control what is regarded as without end/endless (infinite) and without beginning. He ensures that it never disappears, He can make it look as if this has happened if he wishes.

So, first of all, nonsensical embodiment. More specifically and clearly, what does being 'embodiment' of something really mean? Especially of such a generic concept. Also, it does seem to be pantheized, yet this still has Sans motifs in the form? What? And seriously, there's an LA that's also opposed?   
Jargon explanation:

  
LA = big list of words (i.e. "age, past, future, attributes, dreams, nightmares, concrete, abstract, quantum, atom, atomical, theories, existence")

  
Opposed = the use of things like "existence or nonexistence" (in this case, would be formatted as "(non)existence"). 

  
Omnipotence embodiment: not only does this conflict with every other AU but also, likely with himself as well.

  
Box Embodiment: Wait wait wait wait, wait since when was everything contained in a box? Why would it be a box? And not a sphere? 

  
Another running thing: "Find and Replace". At some point, many of the mentions of King Godverse were changed to use a first person pronoun instead of his name or "he", which I call "Find and Replace". This resulted in grammatical oddities like "I always carries this Mighty Scepter". Here, it seems to have happened in reverse, where "King Godverse" was replaced with "he". (I.e. And backfired or turned against he).   
Also, since when is creating universes impossible to monotheistic deities? I feel like that is like, the first thing one of the most famous monotheistic deities did.   
   
Also, "eternity" must be one of author's favorite concepts, lmao.  


 

>Omni-Physiology Transformation  
>  
>King Godverse can transform into all Physiologies, for example he can turn into a Ghost Physiology etc.  
>  
>**Gestalt Monotheistic Deity Physiology:**King Godverse is gestalt supreme being of all existence and a composite supreme being.  
>  
>**Omnipotent Deity Physiology:**King Godverse is a monotheistic deity and supreme being, one supreme transcendent being that created and rules over absolutely everything.

So this "gestalt" and "Deity" comparison makes me think of a character from my friend's setting, named Resolution, which is an AI god supported by a human consciousness collective. I assume that it was used here as just jargon, but it seems like a nice coincidence. Also, "rules over" again.   
And what does "transforming into all physiologies" mean? What does 'Ghost Physiology" mean? Don't ghosts behave differently depending on the universe?   


>Lawlessness and Violation of Everything  
>  
>King Godverse transcends and opposes all of the fictional logic, illogicality, and laws with endless layers and numbers. He can cause unbelievable events that no one can do by transcending the laws and rules of the Omnipotence, Anything lower than that doesn't even exist for him, as he opposes or surpasses all of them.

Transcending the rules of omnipotence... This seems like another way he's trying to bypass the stone paradox. Which, well, yeah. I covered attempts to bypass paradoxes before. Also, I never thought we would see this, but... runaway abilities!  
This says any abilities below his power level don't exist for him. Which thus, makes him way stronger than said abilities. Which brings new types of abilities into the range of being below his power level. Which causes a runaway chain reaction. Which, of course, can be solved by admitting that power levels as a concept are fundamentally flawed and try to quantify too many things at once. And thus, removing this ability.  


>Superior Irrelevant Outlier Antithetical  
>  
>He can ignore any rules, laws, limits, logic and etc. He can destroy and break any ideas promotions by just looking, sample:"You cant defeat me, Im stronger than you" Even if it's written or thought, King Godverse doesn't care and can easily beat you. He dont care about them, even the author's writes about their OCs or Characters.

So, here I'm gonna bring up "irrelevant". The use of this always kinda weirds me out since it seems like it refers to an extremely low power level rather than an extremely powerful one. But also, doesn't he already automatically ignore everything? But also, this ability conflicts with King Godverse's previous ability where comparing power levels causes characters to become puppets, which implies that he DOES care what authors say about him. And in that case, shuck you King Godverse. 

 

>Omni-Godly TransWanked  
>  
>King Godverse transcends beyond the concept of powers, and the concept of percentages. He can kill all potence, divine, unkillable, undefeatable, god, overpowered and etc beings just by existing and not doing anything. Sometimes, he is even stronger than himself and others, and beat beings that are more powerful than him or not be defeated by beings that can easily defeat them by just existing. He is transcend beyond above all other characters or OCs

Honestly, these meta references hardly even mean anything anymore. Just say he's omnipotent and decanonize any being stronger than him in your AU and that does the exact job that this is trying to do. Also, they admit about power wanking. This is also just omnivastance. And that "unkillable" is lonely and doesn't like being surrounded by all those other words, maybe an "otherwise" could be its friend? (I'm gonna keep coming up with funnier and more anthropomorphic ways to call out missing "otherwise".)  
 

>Infinity Concepts of All  
>  
>Any written, unwritten, thought, unthought, created and uncreated, etc. It transcends the concept of infinity in any way, so any concept of infinity cannot scratch it.

Another opposed statement, but this time this isn't even ability. It's just a random sentence about something unrelated to King Godverse.  


 

>Superiority Above All of Beyond  
>  
>King Godverse is superior to all in all things and thus is absolutely invincible. He is boundlessly above absolutely beyond everything, existence, nonexistence, possibility, causality, dualism and non-dualism. Because of he is eternal of anything, he is in infinite probability more powerful than all and all. He's even the beyond the concept of beginning so it doesn't matter if he has a story or an orginal, he can do it if he wants. King Godverse is exactly beyond anything, from beyond the universe, the multiverse, the omniverse, the box, where time and space may not exist. He is superior to every OC and Creation, when any OC or Creation is created, thought, not thought, cannot think of, can think of, existed, never existed, never existed, always existed, created and not created etc. In any case, KG becomes infinitely and beyond them.

Why are the ability names beginning to sound like Everywhere At The End Of Time Stage 3 soundtracks? And why are LAs so common here? Just say "Superior to every OC and creation". No need for all this "can think of, existed, created" klunk. And this is just repeating the runaway power "powering up to be infinitely beyond people" from before, lmao. WTF. I get that at some point in these 133 shuck abilities you're gonna run out of something. 

 

>Boundless-God Transcendent High-God Highest Reality Manipulation  
>  
>King Godverse can manipulate, create, control or destroy reality in its entirety. It provides superiority by controlling any reality at absolute levels, it can control every universe, it can instantly change the whole reality of the Fiction. In short, he is the absolute master of reality.

Well, King Godverse can do that? Well... So can I.  
King Godverse now exists within reality.   
King Godverse no longer exists.  
Simple.  


>Boundless-God Transcendent High-God Highest Alpha Reality  
>  
>King Godverse possess limitless power over the Alpha Reality. He can create, destroy and control all kinds of universal realities. King Godverse is beyond all existence and beyond.

What is the Alpha Reality? I'm continuing this because of "Alpha Reality" and other new jargon that may enter. What does "Alpha Reality" mean?  


>Superiority True Boundless-God Omni-Transcendence  
>  
>King Godverse transcends absolutely anything and everything. This includes all dimensions, life/death, beginning/ending, concepts/ideas/principles, creation/destruction, boundaries, context, potential, possibilities/variables, levels of reality, existence/nonexistence, perfection/levels of perfection, embodiments, their personal status, being/non-being, etc. It is impossible to categorize it in any way or find a complete definition, as they exist completely above and beyond all classifications and definitions. It is boundless and surpasses absolutely everything. He's even the beyond the concept of beginning so it doesn't matter if he has a story or an orginal, he can do it if he wants.

You missed "Flawless" again. And half of this ability is an LA. At this point I'm criticizing the writing more than the abilities. And keep an eye on that misspelling - "orginal". We're gonna see it a lot later. And if they exist above all classifications and definitions why do you continue to list out these stupid abilities?  
   
And what does "transcends" mean? That's actually something I wonder. Let's actually attempt to break down the meaning of "True Boundless God Flawless Transcendent Transfictional". 

  
True = used to specify an ultimate form of an ability or something, at least in most power scaling I've seen. 

  
Boundless-God = This is a tier of 'god-like abilities', probably set in place by some power scaling wiki. 

  
Flawless = simply its English definition. 

  
Transcendent = Well, I'm aware of the word, but I don't actually really know for sure what it means? I think it means "goes beyond" etc. Just based on word roots. But clearly it has some other special meaning.  

  
Transfictional = Interacting outside fiction or between fictional universes.

 

>Boundless-God Transcendent Eyes of God  
>  
>King Godverse can watch absolutely everything, everywhere, everywhen, and everyhow a.k.a fiction at the exact same time and regardless of where or when it is or might be. He can view realities outside of the whole of existence, into dimensions shielding against every form of observation, no matter where it is, he can see every area, entity and object at the same time, can see the past, the present and the future at the same time, all of which are valid. All that is, isn't, might, might not, could, could not, can, can't and won't exist is visible and laid bare before King Godverse, and nothing can be hidden from his eyes.

Ah yes. "Realities outside the whole of existence". Keep the contradictions coming, author. He is literally omnipresent though, so besides the jargon and the opposed sequence, this ability actually seems like a pretty reasonable derivation of omnipresence.  


 

>Boundless-God Transcendent Omnisphere Manipulation  
>  
>King Godverse can manipulate the concept of totality, and is capable of manipulating the entirety of anything. He can manipulate the totality, which is forever the largest thing conceptualized and imagined by any mind. It absolutely encompasses anything and everything. Even though King Godverse can transcend everything and has power over everything too, they may or may not be the origin of it all. It also gives him an extremely powerful force that allows him to control and manipulation of the Omnisphere, which contains an absolutely infinity or unlimited number of other universes, multiverses, metaverses, zenoverses, Superverses, hyperverses, Omegaverses, ultraverses, Omniverses, Outerverse, Alphaverse, Numberverse and etc.

Here is the collection of verses so far:

* Universe
* Multiverse
* Facebookverse
* Zenoverse
* Superverse
* Hyperverse
* Omegaverse
* Ultraverse
* Omniverse
* Outerverse
* Alphaverse
* Numberverse
* Infinitiverse
* Chronoverse
* Xenoverse
* Allverse  


So first of all, what even is a "Numberverse"? What are any of these types of "verses"? Just say multiverse! Or just use the highest one of these since it contains the previous ones? Just say "A Pond"! (thanks to K for recognizing this and the OK Positive bot for sharing it) And what is the "Omnisphere"?   


 

>Boundless-God Transcendent Boundless Manipulation  
>  
>King Godverse has complete access to every and all Boundless abilities, abilities which are fully unbound and are the most powerful abilities to ever exist, and will stay the most powerful abilities, as these abilities grow more powerful by the second.

He has boundless omnipotence as a subset of his "true boundless god flawless omnipotence" from earlier, though, right? So he would already have access to this? What if my abilities grow more powerful by the millisecond? Would they overtake these abilities? Then there is an assumption or contradiction in this ability.  


>Boundless-God Transcendent TransFictional Manipulation  
>  
>King Godverse can manipulate TransFiction in a way that is far superior to god level and do whatever he wants.

So funnily enough, my comment here isn't about transfiction, but about "god level". What is "god level"? Is it from Power Levels Pro? Like, Creator, Destroyer, Terrible, Insane, God levels in that channel?  


>Boundless-God Transcendent Almighty Absorbing Replication  
>  
>King Godverse can absorb anything including concepts like probability and general; space-time, reality and dimensions into themselves and replicate all the properties, characteristics, and features along with everything associated with it. concepts, powers, universal definitions, laws, boundaries, possibly, totality, He can absorb everything and anything;existence, nonexistence and possibilities etc. without limit and can use them in anyway. He doesn't even need to take any action. And can even be recombined, deconstructed, and synthesized.

So, this is a passive ability! You know how I feel about those. Other than that, I don't really have anything more to say, I believe absorbing was already brought up, and between that and the "Wanked" thing I think this might just be someone's fetish.  
 

>Boundless-God Transcendent Omni-Manipulation  
>  
>King Godverse can manipulate anything, absolutely everything -- be it physical (matter, energy, the space-time fabric, etc.); or metaphysical (soul, life, death, aspects of reality, and concepts).

So that is the same as just the change inducement from before? I'm SURE you have your reasons for listing this separate from omnipotence (maybe just as an example), but like...   


>Boundless-God Transcendent Absolute Manipulation  
>  
>King Godverse can create, shape and manipulate absolutes, the complete, unchanging, eternal/infinite and highest aspects, qualities or properties of things. He has the absolute level of all he has.

Snore.

>Boundless-God Transcendent Absolute Force Manipulation  
>  
>King Godverse possess supernatural forces to create, manipulate and shape force in all its forms, whether physical, transcendent, natural, spiritual, mental, cosmic, etc. i.e. all the absolute forces that make up the flow and nature of reality.

OK, but like... why is this ability named almost the same as the previous one?  


>The Highest Code Patronizer  
>  
>King Godverse is the manager and master of every code. Since he is a master hacker and code manager, he can change everything.

So, this goes into another very common assumption of abilities! Specifically, that everything is somehow based on code, which is unconfirmed in our universe and can be false in fictional settings (Undertale is unique in even implying that the code is canon, though it's still very, VERY up to interpretation and most AUs don't really pay much attention to it. As such, EUC is actually immune to this specific form of his abilities, being codeless.  


>Boundless-God Transcendent Omni-Purification  
>  
>King Godverse can purify natural forces, abstract/conceptual features, people with dark hearts and souls, and anything and everything that seems meaningless to Him, even things that, by definition, are or should be immune.

"Purify" runs into the same relative definition problem as "perfect", and as such should probably fall under the manipulation thing from before.  


> If King Godverse finds a big opponent(which is very, very rare)he may choose to get more OP himself more and more every second. This continues until the King Godverse. Besides, King Godverse can buff himself as well as weaken himself, but he does not do that much. And he can also immediately strengthen himself if he wants. Even now, he becomes infinitely more inconceivably stronger than every second. If a creator or character himself tries to surpass King Godverse, King Godverse will instantly notice this and instantly surpass the character. 

So, this ability has a section that is blatantly copy-pasted TWICE elsewhere in the ability list. Specifically, "If a creator or character himself tries to surpass... ...will instantly notice this and instantly surpass the character". Firstly, this assumes quantifiable power levels, but secondly, it shows how repetitive the ability list is getting.   


>Transcendent Dimensional Intelligence  
>  
>It is known by almost everyone that King Godverse can transcend all dimensions, but these dimensions are not limited to the dimensions we know, King Godverse can immediately detect and interact with anything done about him on his websites. I can know who is reading everything, I can know who contributed, I can know who produced it, I can read everything at once, I can see everything, I can know what everybody is really, I already know what I really are, I can know lies and truth, any I am not affected by dimensions, I can know every behavior, I can control activities of all dimensions, I can control any setting at my own request, I can be an administrator as I want, I can see the world ... and more. I transcend all concepts and still cannot be conceptualized.

IF SO, THEN WHAT IS THE SHUCK POINT OF THE WIKI PAGE?????  


>Oneness  
>  
>King Godverse one with all. He's is everything, everywhere, every-when, and every-how, without any exception whatsoever.

Look, at this point now I just have to say, "no he isn't". Like, what? How would this even work? Also, you forgot "every-who" and "every-why".  


 

>Transcendent God-Consumer Beam  
>  
>King Godverse can choose to release rays that can immediately destroy the absolute reality that persists until the eyes are closed. When fired, this beam can destroy at least 10 Multiverse at the same time and erase it from existence. This ray is very dangerous in every way because every reality depends on it the moment it is teleported. Especially weak entities from Omni404 can be instantly destroyed by this beam. The damage of this beam cannot be conceptualized that is beyond mind. The beam may not only go in one direction, but radiate at a 360 degree angle if one wishes, that is up to the King Godverse.

So, breaking this up, Persists until the eyes are closed? What eyes? His eyes? Isn't he fundamentally incorporeal? Are the eyes just a way of indicating the ability? Why would he need to indicate it? The damage of the beam... is a number, KGV. "It is beyond mind?" That doesn't mean we don't have tools for understanding huge numbers! I'll redirect you to [https://googology.fandom.com](https://googology.fandom.com) so you can pick the over-large number of your choice.   


>Transcendent God-Consumer Ray  
>  
>It works the same as King Godverse's beam, but this time emanating from his fingers. The new function of this rail, when it spreads, causes permanent damage by distorting reality in random ways and completely erases any place it hits from fiction or causes permanent wounds.

This implies not omnipotent, but also, why just repeat the ability with the reference to another not necessarily existent body part, and having a slightly different effect? Just merge the two, like I did with the Dark Blaster and God Rays in the Alphatale abilities rewritten.  


>King's Totality Glory Eyes  
>  
>TBA

This... could be the only tie to Sans that KGV has left. Given it says TBA, this could very well be a bad time eye. If it is, then that implies that said bad time eye is a form of ability, which, well, Sans' canon bad time eye is just an indicator for an existing ability, and his eye being somehow powerful itself is like, one of the big misconceptions regarding Sans that I see a lot. 

 

>The Totality of Indeterminacy  
>  
>The whole King Godverse is so unstable that it cannot be conceptualized by anyone. Its power always goes further and thus becomes uncertain. Everything is still unclear, except for its power.

Its power is uncertain. Everything is uncertain, except its power. Way to contrdict yourself in the literal next sentence, author.   


 

>Origin of TOTAL War  
>  
>King Godverse reads movements and mind of opponent and every directions of all this relatives of all acts at every instants, while doing all this, masters and adapts all things from opponents and then immediately leads hands and legs and body with evolve and moves for to next to next acts in every omnidirectional and nondirectional, and moreover they becomes far masteritic ever in any case and sense.

So how does this relate to war again? And again with the EATEOT Stage 3 ability names. What does 'masteritic' means? And I'll be mentioning every reference to a not necessarily existent body from this point onwards. This ability has one.  


>True Absolute Transcendent Advantage in Everything  
>  
>King Godverse has an advantage even over a being that is impossible to beat. It has at least 1 advantage over everything, so those who come across it can find ways to beat. At any point at any given time, KG has a permanent advantage over everything.

Look at that "impossible" there! It's feeling sad! Maybe we could get this "otherwise" over here to help cheer it up.   


>Boundless-God Transcendent Cosmic Manipulation  
>  
>King Godverse is able to manipulate cosmic things boundlessly such as manipulating dark energy and dark matter,manipulating gamma rays etc.

Honestly, gamma rays are the thing you should be least concerned with given all this metaphysical garbage. And why is this "Boundless-God" while the other one is "True Absolute"? What would True Absolute Trasncendent Cosmic Manipulation be like? Would it jus change "boundlessly" to "absolutely"?  


>Boundless-God Transcendent Void Manipulation  
>  
>King Godverse can manipulate all forms of Voids on every scale and level without any restriction and can create, edit and destroy them.

You'd think with a character that operates on the scale of entire fiction that an Undertale-specific concept would be a little weird to have a specific example for. It's not even in Undertale! It's just in the Undertale fandom and not even all Undertale multiverses, and when it is present there the idea of a 'void' tends to be horribly misunderstood.  


>Boundless-God Transcendent Meta P.A.R.A.D.O.X  
>  
>King Godverse can manipulate all paradoxes no matter how contradictory, impossible or illogical without justification in highest levels.

Attempts to workaround will not be tolerated.  


>Boundless-God Transcendent Meta/Omni-Fate Manipulation  
>  
>King Godverse can manipulate all destinies and fates in absolute levels of anyone/anything.

Strangely enough... omnipotence-omniscience paradox! That's right, destinies and fates imply predetermination, which is the exact element of omniscience that makes omnipotence impossible.   


>Transcendent Exile of Justice  
>  
>If someone does something illegal, arranges an assassination, or someone attacks him for no reason, King Godverse can send that person into eternal exile. Nobody will survive this exile and will enter the endless death loop. The location of this exile is unknown and cannot be entered or exited by anyone except King Godverse. Here he will suffer eternal suffering and be condemned to eternal death. The abilities of anyone who is thrown here will become useless and they will not be able to use any of their skills or gain abilities. The fate of everyone who falls here depends on the King Godverse.

So... why do the abilities need to be listed so specifically? This is like, a different kind of specific as well, where instead of just saying omnipotence in different ways, it's listing very specific abilities together with omnipotence. This honestly seems like a wanked version of Banishment from Alphatale. (Don't remember which character.)

 

>Boundless-God Transcendent Pataphysics Manipulation  
>  
>King Godverse can manipulate Pataphysics, he can control over the ineffable, the unknown and the unknowable, transcending metaphysical laws and boundaries. that it doesn't have an unequivocal definition that passes easily from one state of apparent definition to another. Beyond truth, reality, and everything.

What is Pataphysics? Also, the otherwise unknowable, as it turns out. If he doesn't know it, how can he control it? What is this "state of apparent definition" stuff? It seems like all the "Sentence" stuff that people use when trying to disprove omniscience, which I hate.  


>Boundless-God Transcendent Molecular Manipulation  
>  
>King Godverse can manipulate molecules, a group of atoms and the smallest unit of a physical substance or compound to achieve a wide variety of effects. I have all Molecular Powers.

I feel like these abilities were added before all the omnipotence stuff was, similarly to the spear/Mighty Scepter. That would be the best explanation for all the random specific abilities. Either that, or each ability somehow only has a specific "range" of the ability list which it covers and we're now out of that for omnipotence. 

&#x200B;

>Boundless-God Transcendent Meta-Logic and illogic Manipulation  
>  
>King Godverse can control, change, or manipulate any logic and illogic.

No, he can't. Specifically, he can't manipulate my logic.  


 

>Transcendent Extrasensory Perception(ESP)  
>  
>Due to having an omnipotent psychic mind, King Godverse can acquire information by means independent of any of His known senses or previous experience. This applies to any and all kinds of information, knowledge, wisdom, experience, etc. Information can be either personal (memories, thoughts, etc.) or impersonal (academic knowledge, data, etc.). He can either used it passively (as an instinctual reaction) or actively (by wanting to know specific information).

Why is "Extrasensory Perception" abbreviated but none of the other abilities are? That would have been useful for all the "True Boundless" spam. And no, we aren't out of the range of omnipotence, Molecular Manipulation. So, you have no need to exist.  


>Boundless-God Transcendent Physics Manipulation  
>  
>King Godverse can create, shape, and manipulate the Laws of Physics, everything dealing with matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force and etc.

Honestly, as a creator ability, reasonable if restricted to his own creations. (Though I know that it probably isn't.)  


>Boundless-God Transcendent Conceptual Lordship  
>  
>King Godverse can embody, manifest and manipulate all concepts.

Here's the "embody" stuff. Also, lordship? Really? Was that the best way to describe this ability?  


>Boundless-God Transcendent Omni+ Conceptual Manipulation  
>  
>King Godverse can create or manipulate all the concepts and incomprehensible concepts of Fiction in Supreme scales.

Snore the 2nd.  


>The Fictional Eraser  
>  
>King Godverse can destroy and erase any fictional being or creation. Any tangible existence, any physical existence, an invincible existence and so on. He can destroy and delete them. By completely destroying an entity and removing all of its effects forever, it is as if it never existed. If he wants, he can kill anyone instantly. There is no limit.

First of all, that "invincible" really wants an "otherwise" to be right next to it. Also, conflicts with omnipotence with that "forever" stuff.  


>Transcendent Ancestry Consumption of Fiction  
>  
>King Godverse can make all things never exist again by exhausting their lineage, this will happen no matter who it is, and the reincarnation of being will be canceled.

So, some weird assumption surrounding why things exist? And also, conflicts with omnipotence with "never exist again", unless you want to "continuity identity" me and say that the recreated thing is different. In which case he's still not omnipotent because stone paradox (and regarding this, actually something similar to stone paradox as well, regarding some semantically defined thing that he is unable to do).  


>Transcendent Absolute Condition  
>  
>King Godverse has the absolute beyond absolutely boundless, High-Omnieternal∞ and High-Omni-Transcient∞(It is everywhere imaginable, everywhere non-imaginable, everywhere beyond imagination and non-imagination. It is everywhere that everything and nothing is, and everywhere everything and nothing isn't.) of mental, physical, strength, speed, intelligence, etc.

Drinking game: Take a shot for every "every" in this quote. And what? "Non-imagination"? Now the opposed statements are getting plain silly.  


>Boundless-God Transcendent Imagination  
>  
>King Godverse's imagination is unlimited and he can make everything he imagines come true in an instant.

So just... boundless creator ability, and thus subset of omnipotence, and also, in range of "Omni+ Conceptual Manipulation" which includes this.  


>Chains of God  
>  
>these chains have excellent strength. When King Godverse uses these chains, the entity undergoes a great weight and begins to suffer. These chains, which can pull everything off, are quite dangerous.

But... why are they chains? Another pre-omnipotent ability, I'm assuming.  


>Self-Existence  
>  
>King Godverse cannot be dependent on anyone or changed anything by anyone, for example, no one can decide King Godverse's fate, his reality cannot be changed, so he depends on himself.

Exactly equivalent effect: 

>Meta note: only what I write about King Godverse is canon unless I say otherwise.

You don't need to make it an ability.  


>Transcendent Meta/Omni-Laws Manipulation  
>  
>King Godverse can received the power to rewrite, control, redefine and create any law he want in the Godverse, usually applies this when necessary.

I don't know if "Godverse" here refers to a specific AU or a layer of universes, but I'm gonna add it to the collection just to be safe.  


>Flawless Stealth  
>  
>King Godverse can remain undetected, even by Omnipresent beings.

Okay. Though...  
Ok, honestly, where does it actually imply omnipresent means that? Honestly, (nigh) omniscient would be a better word there. And it would allow me to make an "otherwise" joke.  


>King Aura  
>  
>Anyone who goes close to King Godverse feels obliged to respect to him.

Another pre-omnipotent ability! Honestly, out of context, this is just basic mental manipulation, which is like, a little ehh, but still fine by me. In-context, however, it's plain silly.  


>God Summon  
>  
>King Godverse can summon any God. He can summon non-gods if he wants.

Why call it "God Summon" then? Also, are you sure all gods can even be summoned?  


>ZER0  
>  
>King Godverse can revert something, like transform Error into Geno. but full potential of this button turns others into their purest forms. to ther OG Undertale Counterparts.

First of all, this is a button. Not unlike RSS' button to revert King Godverse's reversion lmao. Also, implications that  a) everything has an OG Undertale counterpart, and b) things that do have that as their 'purest form'. Which, are not true in the slightest. Also, why is this called "ZER0" (with a zero digit as the O)?   


 

>Boundless-God Transcendent Nullification, Negation and Obsolescence  
>  
>King Godverse can age anything up to make it feel like a rebirth. King Godverse can also think of anything, neutralize something, easily restore something. And he can make anything, everything, anyone or everyone useless, he can make useless anything you can think of to work.

Ummm, uhhh, what do these two things have in common? What the heck? Why are they listed together? And  


>Locking Operation  
>  
>King Godverse can lock and encrypt everything;powers, times, codes, logics and anything.

I feel like I might make a "clean" version of KGV with only the pre-omnipotent abilities. (And I'll be using March revision, to avoid spam.   


>Beyond The True Limits  
>  
>King Godverse is a limitless being. He really has beyondly breaks true limits of anything, no limit In any subject, Therefore, it is always infinitely more powerful than the previous one. He is stronger than anyone with absolutely every possibility and outcome in anything, no matter what, as he even crosses and breaks true boundaries. It can be infinitely superior to even a limitless being. No being with boundaries or absolutely non-transcendent can approach or even scratch the King Godverse. Saying he has no limitations or limits causes it to exceed even absolute infinity, so if someone tries to catch up with its power, it will not happen because it will be superior to it in every calculation. Trying to limit his power won't even mean anything to him.

And now we get back to the deranged spam. Honestly, no comment at this point. Except that we've seen the "trying to limit his power won't mean anything" before. And also, absolute infinity? That one clickbait "number" that everyone puts in Youtube thumbnails?   


>Necromancy  
>  
>King Godverse can bring every dead person who dies in fiction back to life and make them his slaves if he want. But when he is brought back to life them King Godverse usually brings them back to life for makes them slaves. Irrecoverable lines are formed around the eyes of beings returning to life. If King Godverse wishes, he can give free will to those who come back to life.

The lines thing a) assumes said beings have eyes, and b) clearly indicates this is a pre-omnipotent ability, however, this "in fiction" says otherwise. Maybe it was added during the transfictional wave, or maybe it's just weird. IDK.  


>Highest Beyond of Infinite Dimensional  
>  
>King Godverse exists in all dimensions and exceeds all dimensions, he cannot be destroyed even by the highest higher powers.

Geometrical vs fantasy dimensions... Now I'm honestly not sure what I'm supposed to interpret this as.  


>Boundless-God Transcendent Magician & Sorcerer  
>  
>Like OP God Error404, King Godverse has unlimited access to all forms of magic and other mystical and supernatural powers. In short, it works the same as the OP God Error404 but is a superior version.

Why call it "magic", "mystical", "Supernatural"? Bruh. In whatever setting it's in, it's most likely normal. Also, OP God 404 is actually OP God Error404 apparently. Better take notes of that.  


>Boundless-God Transcendent Meta/Omni-Origin Manipulation

Let's cause a time paradox!  


>Boundless-God Transcendent Existence Manipulation

Snore the 3rd.  


>Transfictional, Fandom and Beyond Access

>King Godverse has full access to everything outside the real world, including the Meta-Narrtives and Transfiction, and is present in everything he can access. Transfiction, Fandom and Beyond, No limit.

Narrtives? Really? Also, I find all this meta bullklunk kinda weird. Why have it? Why have it as an ability, even?  


>Transcendent Absolute Precision  
>  
>King Godverse's range is incredible, he never misses his attacks.

"Never"... eh? I doubt that's true for pre-omnipotent Godverse, which is how I'm comparing this since all the "TRUE BOUNDLESS OMNIPOTENT" klunk would make it pointless anyhow.  


>Boundless-God Transcendent Omnibenevolence and Omnimalevolence  
>  
>King Godverse's the greatest evil and the greatest good.

Never thought I would see omnibenevolence and omnimalevolence here! Let's talk about the omnibenevolence-omnipotence paradox. If someone is the greatest good, at least as usually described theistically, they can't do evil things, making them not omnipotent. Conversely for omnimalevolence. Though really, what do good and evil really mean! This is like the evil matter from a previous thing: I'm evil from the perspective of one of my C4 civilizations.   


>Boundless-God Transcendent Boundary Manipulation

>King Godverse can complete control of all boundaries.

But uh, what does that mean, exactly?  


>Boundless-God Transcendent Absolute Quantum Manipulation

>  
>**Quantum Telekinesis:**King Godverse can use quantom physics like your phone call and break down what it holds into quantums. In short, this is his telekinesis.

Ah, the "quantum" buzzword that a lot of OP stuff uses. At least this has some sort of understanding of what it is. But also, why doesn't he have normal telekinesis? What? And what do you mean my phone call?   


>Boundless-God Transcendent Omni-Mentality Manipulation  
>  
>King Godverse can reset, check or rewrite everyone's mind. It can change the minds of minds and inflict permanent damage forever, often recruiting servants or slaves as such. This is the absolute and infinite version of mental manipulation.

Permanent contradicts omnipotence #3. And he already has mental manipulation, as evidenced by several other abilities of his.  


>Boundless-God Transcendent Totality Manipulation  
>  
>King Godverse can transcend everything and has power over everything.

Yes, uh, this has been said before. In fact, I think with this exact phrasing. Yeah, in Omnisphere Manipulation.  


>Boundless-God Meta Transcendent Force Matter and Anti-Matter

>King Godverse can create, shape, manipulate, summon, destroy and customize all possible forms of matter, whether organic or inorganic, baryonic or non-baryonic, etc.. This also extends to “exotic matter”, such as dark matter, antimatter, tachyons, and other highly theoretical forms of matter.  
>  
>He can manipulate matter from alternate timelines, dimensions, universes, etc., using their immense power to pluck it from one of the aforementioned categories and materialize it to their location. Along with this, he can also create new types of matter and imbue them with properties of their choosing, creating matter not of the normal variety. For example he could create matter that grants powers to its wielder or matter that has properties or a structure that defies the established laws of physics.  
>  
>At their strongest, he can manipulate quantum foam, the smallest level and foundation of reality as we currently know it.

Snore the 4th, honestly. It's just a big jumble of LAs and physics lessons (and non-physics lessons).   


>Only Orginal.  
>  
>If anyone tries to make a clone of King Godverse (like an alternative King Godverse etc.), the being himself will turn into a willless slave and lose all his powers, and those powers will be transferred to the King Godverse, including in his clone. If a creator tries this, the creator's powers will be transferred to King Godverse and will not be able to access fiction for a long time. Even if a creator(s) himself copies all of his powers, those powers will be back to King Godverse and will be far superior/mixing, making himself invincible again. This applies to anyone copying his powers on the web. You are empowering me even as you try to steal my powers or to weaken me. If a creator or character himself tries to surpass me, I will instantly notice this and instantly surpass the character. Even reading me, even seeing me, copying me, even writing me, even rewriting me and etc it makes me superior by making me stronger than what you are doing.~~Did you seriously try to create an asset to fill my place? how ironic.~~

No, this doesn't happen.  
"King RSSverse is a stronger version of King Godverse with RSS Sans' abilities."  
"King RSSverse is, still, a stronger version of King Godverse with RSS Sans' abilities."   
You see how the power level didn't change? King RSSverse is NOT a slave of King Godverse, and I still have access to fiction! You see? Alphard acquired Minecraft abilities approximately 4 years ago!   
Also, there's that "Orginal" spelling back!   


 

>Boundless-God Transcendent Absolute Vector Manipulation  
>  
>King Godverse can manipulate the vectors of anything and everything they choose to interact with. Everything perceived by King Godverse is a vector. He can manipulate magic, quasiphysical and any kind of energy, quantum level particles and even scarce energies themselves for precise empowerment.

GUYS GUYS I'M EVERYTHING TO KING GODVERSE (my online name is Vector Graphics). Also, magic.   


 

>Boundless-God Transcendent Beyond Manipulation  
>  
>He can manipulate the entirety of the Beyond, an absolute, limitless force with no restrictions to his power. He can cancel Omnipotent level abilities,,completely manipulating everything and everyone,completely warp Beyond Gods and etc. In short he is beyond.

Misunderstanding of omnipotent, and also, assumptions regarding metaphysics. And that "in short" does NOT summarize the ability.   


>SCREAM OF GODS  
>  
>King Godverse can scream a deafening hour for an hour. It's impossible to survive this scream, and if you hear this scream, your fate depends on the King Godverse.

Yet another pre-omnipotent ability that conflicts with omnipotence! Also, I feel like I might understand what the whole "impossible" thing is where it doesn't have "otherwise". It's in references to things like this that explicitly say "impossible", where another character then says "I can do impossible things", not in reference to the actual meaning of impossible, but in reference to these types of uses of impossible. Still calling it out because it's stupid, but I think I know.  


>True Boundless-God Transcendent Omnificence and Omni-Destruction  
>  
>King Godverse can create destroy absolutely anything without limits, including concepts, existence, universes, reality, and everything that exist or doesn't exist.

This was mentioned prior. Also, exists and doesn't exist!   


>Boundless-God Transcendent Omnifarious  
>  
>King Godverse ecan create an unlimited number of copies.

So, this could either mean duplicating himself (thus disabling both himself and his clone by Only Orginal), (which, I mean, I wouldn't put it past author to have something like that), but I feel like more likely meaning is just as a realization of overmind ability (a particularly overpowered one, at that). And I'm all for that.  
 

>Highest Consumer Hands of King  
>  
>King Godverse can summon too high to be conceptualized amount of chrome hands. These hands work just like Gaster's but are far superior and stronger. They can use any of King Godverse's physical abilities and far beyond have weight, but also buoyancy. In short, this is his Chrome Hands.

These hands work like Gaster's hands. But how do Gaster's hands work? Pff, I don't know. But actually, this brings up an important point? I get giving Gaster a hand theme, it's a theme that isn't really used by other monsters outside somewhat Toriel, but like, why then go ahead and turn the hands into plain boring blasters? Why not do stuff with, like, what hands actually are? Gestures with special powers? (A middle finger dealing psychic damage, say, or finger guns actually shooting?) Slaps? Punches? Grabs? Throws? It's a really versatile thing.  


 

>Boundless-God Transcendent Exceeding\[PRESENCE\]  
>  
>King Godverse can transcend any dimension, existing or not, and come to the end of fiction. Except for Omniverse and higher abilities, abilities do not affect him, even if they do, they are very few.

So, what are these abilities that affect King Godverse? I wanna know! It seems it includes all Omniverse abilities... \*looks at RSS Sans\* And why is \[PRESENCE\] in brackets like that?   


 

>Boundless-God Transcendent Nonexistence Inevitable  
>  
>Godverse King can control, manipulate or destroy everything that exists. If he sees what he does not want, he will not exist in their minds. It can make everything non-existent, and it itself does not exist whenever it wants. If someone ceases to exist, even the smallest thing they do will be wiped out of fiction and reality. Unimaginable and terrible.

Snore the 5th. Why be so repetitive? I literally, have no comments on this one except that I can't understand the causality here.   


 

>Boundless-God Transcendent Judgement  
>  
>He can judge every thing, decide everything he wants. Everything in the Godverse and Fiction is and will be decide by him.

No, I'm deciding that he's shuck stupid. He didn't decide that! I did!   


 

>Reincarnation and Regeneration of King  
>  
>If King Godverse dies somehow(which is impossible)he will instantly re-spawn in Supreme Kingdom of Gods. And if any part gets torn, damaged or even scratched, it will regenerate.

So this feels like it's a pre-omnipotent ability that got the "which is impossible" segment added over time. Given the out of place lack of spaces. Also, why have an ability that will never even apply?  


 

>Boundless-God Transcendent 4th Wall Manipulation  
>  
>King Godverse can interact to 4th wall and beyond, speak to creator, transition to the main world and etc. King Godverse can also access any internet platform or access on any technology like Computers. He knows all the information written on the internet and technology(and Real World events). He even knows everything about top secret organizations and what to do. King Godverse can talk to creators as he can break the 4th wall. He's exists in all Meta-narratives. The closest to reality is even in Meta-narrative and Non-fiction.

No, he can't.

>Mirror-Reality

Actually normal pre-omnipotent ability!? Huh.   


>Hyper MetaFictional-Metawareness  
>  
>King Godverse is aware of the real world and can see the movements of creators in all ways. He has complete control over editing but cannot reach the real world, he can only hear. He can watch fiction just like a creator.

Again, no he can't. Stop trying to say things like this.

Only 100 km, eh? Better get training!   


>Non-Physical Interaction  
>  
>King Godverse is capable of Interacting with Intangible Beings, Incorporated beings, nonexistent beings, non-corporeal, abstract and etc.

Ummmm, so am I? It's not like non-corporeal means uninteractable. In fact, given he's incorporeal, such beings are very interactable. It doesn't matter cuz he'll just ignore everything, but still.  


>Transcendent Impotent!  
>  
>any power that cannot overcome god or god, any power that cannot surpass the Omniverse, any power that is connected to the Universe, any power that is not aware of the Fiction, any power that does not have Authority and etc. is ineffective for King Godverse. The power of King Godverse is so extraordinary and eroded that these beings cannot even enter the concept of power for King Godverse.

It doesn't say who has this power, so I'm going to assume this is in reference to RSS Sans. Also, a weird kind of LA where it's a "spammy LA" where it lists alternative words WITH a shared prefix, in this case "any power that".   


>Duality  
>  
>this ability called duality allows him to complately rule and manupilate oppositeforces like creation and destruction.positivity and negativity. Orange and blue

But yellow and blue are opposites, not orange and blue. And don't go 'undertale', this character has CLEARLY established his non-association with Undertale. Also, "this ability allows"? This is I think the first time I've seen it in King Godverse. I dislike it because it's not really that natural of a description of a character's capabilities. It reads more like the skills you would press number keys to use in a game, which I'm not really a fan of.  


 

>Boundless-God Transcendent Space-Time Manipulation  
>  
>King Godverse can manipulate and control all of Space-Time. He can distort Space-Time. For example, he can deflect an attack that comes to him in another direction, and it is enough for him to think.

No comment. Honestly pretty reasonable if you remove the jargon.

&#x200B;

>Boundless-God Transcendent Time Manipulation  
>  
>King Godverse can control the time for an unlimited time.

Self-referential time based ability problem. I find it weird when time-based abilities mention time as part of their conditions. Time... according to what? The altered time? Normal time? Whichever is shorter? Whichever is longer? It doesn't really matter as much here, but it's still strange to see.

&#x200B;

>Boundless-God Transcendent Infinity Manipulation  
>  
>King Godverse can manipulate infinity, manipulate infinite ability, control infinity, manage infinite power, and more.

Honestly, I wouldn't say infinity is something that can be manipulated.

>Science-Magic Ascendancy

>King Godverse is beyond any laws of science or magical force(Archeapotance/Almighty Magic, Anti-Void Magic, any God using A Magical Ability and every singe ability associated with Magic such as Anti-Magic) and Science(Code Manipulations, Law Manipulations, Reality Warping, Sciepotance/Almighty Science, Meta Time-Space Manipulation, Logic Manipulation, Ultipotance, Metapotance and etc.) of any kind. his Ascendancy is not only to these two concepts,But Magic and Science are the Building Stones of this Fictional Verse.  
>  
>***~~"Why chose one when you can Surpass ALL?"~~***

Blah blah jargon and weird 4th wall text. And assumption that magic and science are the building stones of this fictional verse. Also, there is a pretty hefty LA in there.

&#x200B;

>Narrative/Plot Transcendent  
>  
>Just like how he can manipulate Plot itself, King Godverse Trancendents his Current Narrative. However, any Plot controls/manipulations do not affect him.

Wow, it took true boundless omnipotence to NOT BE AFFECTED BY THE STUPID "NARRATIVE" KLUNK ABILITIES THAT A LOT OF CHARACTERS HAVE. Gee.

&#x200B;

>Pain  
>  
>King Godverse can someone feel beyond infinity levels of pain just by looking at them, prevent them passing out and even destroy their understanding of time so that one millisecond is equal for them to eternity of infinity and beyond pain at every cell of their body.

Subset of mental manipulation, and the "beyond infinity" klunk. Anyway, the final ability is coming up shortly.

&#x200B;

>"No Joke"  
>  
>King Godverse can completely delete or control any jokes. And able to control anyone with joke abilities. And for King Godverse, any joke is ineffective,but his joke abilities are effective to everything. anyone's Joke abilities are ineffective for him. 

So, first of all, why is it in quotes, but also, isn't he some kind of a joke character himself? Oh wait, this admits it but gives him a rather convenient exception? Also, how would one be aware of the humorous intentions of abilities in-universe? I get he's transfictional and all that, but otherwise, how would this work?

&#x200B;

>Avatar Creation(read the description)  
>  
>***(not to be confused with author avatars)*** King Godverse can create fake copies of himself to send on other verses to do his work for him. theese entities that represent him may be a clone of equal power or a entirely diffrent entity.

So... This is NOT overmind ability! The reason why? The avatars are fake, implying there is a "Real" body. Which is not really how overminds work. And what is all this spam about confusing this for author avatars? I was confusing author avatars to be overmind avatars for a time because I used a different terminology? And like, how would people confuse it in this context? It's clear that JW and similar characters are NOWHERE NEAR being a part of this, except perhaps being an alternative appearance for a said KGV avatar.   


  
Anyway, that was the final ability! Now, I'm going to send the full text of the "grand daddy" LA (the 600 word one from previously):
