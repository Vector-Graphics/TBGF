# TBGF
A mirror for the TBGF article that was too fat to fit in a Reddit post.
I decided to remaster this and post it on my new account with my current knowledge from making TBGF for 9 parts.

For those of who don't know, **True Boundless God Flawless** is a series where I critique the ability lists of overpowered characters, and in the process explain some of the concepts. In particular, I started this series because I hated King Godverse's abilities. However, that post is very old, and on my old account.So, let's dive into King Godverse yet again!

>Omni-Transcendent Mighty Scepter of the BEYONDER GOD King  
>  
>I have Mighty Scepter that most overpowerfull thing that exist and doesn't exist, almost the same size as himself, this Mighty Scepter dealing damage that cannot be conceptualized by anyone and can destroy those with less power in 2 moves, which is \*\*~~\[Infinite coefficient beyond our incomprehensible understanding.\]~~\*\*stronger when holding it. I usually always carries this Mighty Scepter. And there is only one Mighty Scepter that cannot be duplicated If someone tries to grab this Mighty Scepter, the Mighty Scepter will become very, very heavy, and it will become inconvenient. Cannot be broken, corroded, etc. I usually makes the command operation with this Mighty Scepter, for fun.

So, recently, I have actually discovered an older version of the page where the abilities weren't as absolutely crazy, and can realize that the "infinite coefficient" is actually 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 or something - i.e. not infinite. Also, at some point a lot of the "he" in this was changed to "I", hence the bad grammar like "I usually always carries" - this is actually "he usually always carries".

Additionally, the Mighty Scepter was originally a spear, explaining all the "Mighty Scepter" copypasta.That doesn't change how utterly deranged this ability is, however. "Most overpowerful thing that exists and doesn't exist." Why do people need to put the "doesn't exist" part? Also, OP god characters try not to use 'incomprehensible' challenge. Seriously. Every time I see something being "incomprehensible" I feel like it's an excuse for being lazy with descriptions. It's a number, KGV. I don't think a number is incomprehensible. Especially when that number isn't even actually infinite. Also, if I were writing this page, I would just make this a summon. No need for all the "inconvenient" "cannot be broken, corroded" stuff.

>Absolute Transcendent High-Command of God's Himself  
>  
>I can implement the strongest command available, and using this command, anyone can do impossible things.

OTHERWISE impossible things. Missing "otherwise" counter: 3.Superlative counter: 2 (in this page).Also, I assume this is the "Command operation" with the Mighty Scepter?

>I am the god of all things, I am the god of existence and all things besides being the Godverse god, I am the god of every god, I am beyond the supreme absolute ancient god of all that can or cannot be and etc. In short, I am the god of everything you can think or not. I am all.

And could you please just make the "in short" the whole ability? And what does being 'the god of something' actually mean? That idea really only applies in polytheistic mythologies, not with overpowered characters.

>''God'' Button  
>  
>I was created this button while establishing his kingdom, pressing this button can be ∞x stronger than before or will control a god as if he replaced. Nobody has access to this button. This button works fine only in the hands of me and CC. This button manupilates any POWER,disable any power,can create from nothing and can do anything you can think of or not. This button may not only work on gods.

So first of all, who's CC, second of all. Again, what defines a god from not a god?  Why is "POWER" capitalized? (I know why, it's because this is a giant patchwork, but still, most of this was still made by one person over the course of several months so...)AND WHY IS THIS A BUTTON??????But this also has more gems in the EARLY version of it, because some things actually got removed.

>If anyone tries to use it, they'll become King Godverse's free will slave.

What does "free will slave" actually mean? So like, a regular slave? Since they are people and have free will? The only reason this exists is because this ability is a button. Also, passive abilities.

What I mean when I call out "passive abilities" is abilities that aren't actively activated yet have these large effects and are just like, automatic abilities, can be really inconvenient for the person that has them. It makes an okay superhero, but not a good OP character.

>True Boundless-God Flawless Transcendent Transfictional Omnipotence  
>  
>I am clearly godity omnipotent for all/infinity. I have no boundaries or limitation, I am the giver of the true concept of Omnipotence that the truly supremely almighty, truly invincible and above all OP Gods beings all beyond all. And I am the embodiment of the Omnipotence. I can literally do anything and everything in absolute, eternal, total, boundless, transfiction levels and beyond. I don't need any sence. I can transcend everything, anything and nothing in much larger terms. I usually don't try too hard, I always uses my omnipotent.

Ah, here we are. "True Boundless God Flawless". The name sake of this entire series.

I'd like to bring up the second half of this keyword spam that we'll be seeing as well - "Transcendent Transfictional". Transfictional is a problem. According to various wikis, it relates to being able to interact with reality, something that cannot possibly be expressed due to the way fictional characters work

Stone paradox! The stone paradox is a fundamental issue with omnipotence - can an omnipotent being create the possibility of an action that it can't perform? (I.e. creating a stone that it can't lift). If yes, then it is not omnipotent because it can't perform the action. If no, then it is not omnipotent because it can't create the possibility of said action. This is why I always use "nigh-omnipotence", which is similar to omnipotence, but with an allowance for a proper answer to these types of situations, by not needing to be able to do absolutely everything. Even further, most forms of omnipotence (and indeed most power scaling) seen in fiction are conceptually restricted.

Also, it seems like it is trying to go beyond "regular" omnipotence to TBGFTT omnipotence, when... It's not really like omnipotence has levels? For the purposes of power scaling, if someone is more powerful than you, there's clearly something they can do that you can't, so you aren't omnipotent, so it is then pointless to have different levels of omnipotent.

And what does "godity" mean? I've seen it several times now? Is it the status of being a god? That's godhood, so no. I think it might be god + entity. Or god + deity (that would be as redundant as anything else in this article).

>True Boundless-God Flawless Transcendent Transfictional Omniscience  
>  
>I knows all knowledge, everything, anything and nothing. I knows things that no one knows, and knows what is not. I am transcending the minds of everyone and everything. Truly no limit.

There's several problems with omniscience as well, the most blatant being in conjunction with omnipotence, since the two (at least in their purest form) directly contradict each other, since true omniscience requires some level of predetermination which would conflict with omnipotence. Unless KGV is exempt from it, but then it isn't omniscience.

>True Boundless-God Flawless Transcendent Transfictional OmnipresenceI am in everywhere, anywhere, whenever and nowhere at the same time. Wherever it is i am exists in everywhere at the same time, from the smallest to the largest. Because I transcend time, I am everywhere with or without time, past, present and future. No matter what, my presence is everywhere without exception. You can't see me unless I want to interact. Right now, I am omnipresent, incorporeal, like an invisible being that cannot be seen, felt or heard everywhere.

So, omnipresence. This is actually one of the "omni-" abilities that isn't actually all that bad - a reduced form, latopresence (effective over an area), makes appearances in several of my own worlds. It's also a much more advanced form of the overmind ability in a sense. Going from avatars to a universal presence which can exist anywhere and everywhere. Though, how it could be transfictional, I don't know.For those of you who don't know, I'm a huge advocate for more overpowered characters being able to have multiple avatars. No 'true' body, the consciousness is either distributed between them or detached from a body entirely. This is what I call the "overmind ability", and characters who have this are overminds. Being omnipresent supersedes or includes this.

And then I actually read the ability.So as it turns out there is a paradox with this ability. Not with omnipresence, but some time paradox inevitably resulting from the mention of time within this ability's description.

>True Boundless-God Flawless Transcendent Transfictional Omnivastance  
>  
>King Godverse transcends the rules/laws of the Omnipotent and goes beyond the Omnipotent and the entire powers system to the point of broken and beyond True impossible to Define levels and truly broken and Beyond True Irrelevant just like God. He can easily do impossible things that no power can do, as if it were normal. King Godverse is the embodiment beyond all power, no matter what. Very advantageous in that it transcends all things beyond all power. King Godverse can absolutely do everything independently. He is beyond All Power Systems and creating new kind of concepts, which is beyond All Powers. King Godverse is the description of everything, including every possible, impossible, beyond notions of infinity. In short, I am the beyond everything. Anything he exceeds will not affect him, and whatever fiction is to us will be fiction to him, he sees them as fiction.

Omnivastance! This is a word that has been made up by the power-scaling community to refer to being beyond power-scaling. Not a problem, Alphard has this, and so do most characters, since characters' abilities can't really be summed up with power levels, at least not accurately, and it's not like power levels are an inherent property. For an example, let's take a look at powerscaling The Second Coming from Animator vs. Animation. The problem with this is the environment. The Second Coming can have little to no effect outside the digital world, yet is extremely powerful within it. So is he weak or strong? And what about even within the digital world - he only becomes powerful in certain (currently unknown) circumstances, yet he is also immortal in all circumstances - how would that be reflected?The Second Coming doesn't have a "power level". One cannot say he is weaker or stronger than, say The Dark Lord (another character from AvA) - he's both.

Everyone is omnivastant.

>True Absolute Flawless Transcendent Omni-Invincibility, Omni-Immortality, Omni-Indestructibility, Omni-Invulnerability, Omni-Singularity, Omni-Immutability, Omni-BYPASSING  
>  
>self-explanatory. If you are not stupid, you can understand yourself.  
>  
>It's so boring to explain all of this myself, so I'll get by with the author's explanation, but hey, I'm still here.

So, "Omni-Invulnerability" covers omni-immortality, omni-invincibility, omni-indestructibility. So you don't need that. Also, "immutability" is... a strange one. Usually, when it appears, it definitely isn't omni.But hey, now at least we know what "Omni-BYPASSING" means! King Godverse can bypass 4th Breaker bypassing King Godverse bypassing 4th Breaker's attacks.Also, I don't know what omni-singularity is. Mainly because there are multiple senses of "singularity".

Interestingly, the fact that this says "True Absolute Flawless" instead of "True Boundless God Flawless" is indicative of a difference in the old King Godverse as well - that between "Godversal True Beyond" (True Boundless God Flawless) and "Godversal Beyond" (True Absolute Flawless).

>Over True Absolute Flawless Transcendent Omni-Immunity  
>  
>he has every immunity at the same time. He can use every moment of his immunity. no matter what immunity can not be overcome/bypassed. For example, King Godverse is not affected by mental attacks, it cannot be controlled, instant die protection(I am already immortal). Their abilities cannot be touched or influenced. In short, nobody can interfere with its natural form, the only thing you can do to it is attacks, which will not have great effects. King Godverse is beyond age, illness and all forms of physical harm or spiritual. He is beyond the concepts of time, life and death. It is completely free from existence and any effort to kill it by conventional means is useless. He is absolutely immortal, and cannot die, age, get sick, be permanently wounded, is absolutely self-sustained and, as His mind and soul are as immortal as His biological body, He is immune to mental/spiritual damage. Physical laws, philosophical inquiries, logic, and concepts are inapplicable to it, and these things cannot be used to exert force over it in any conceivable way. King Godverse's existence is completely free and independent of even the concept of reality, making Him unbound to the subjects of fate, life, death, and manipulations. He's immunity to who's weaker than Error404's any form and etc. He is immune to all of the debuff/every abilities of OP destroyers like Error500/Gary Sue, he even got them all for himself and perfected them. If there are situations such as immunity breaking or ignoring, King Godverse will not be affected by it and their immunity will be stronger. Trying to limit him would just be a waste of time and it wouldn't even mean anything to him.

This is... very spammy. Let's try to break it down into more reasonable parts. Removus repetitivus!

>he has every immunity at the same time, which can not be overcome/bypassed. Their abilities cannot be touched or influenced. Nobody can interfere with its natural form, King Godverse is beyond age, illness and all forms of physical harm or spiritual. He is beyond the concepts of time, life and death. Physical laws, and concepts are inapplicable to it. He is immune to every abilities of OP destroyers like Error500/Gary Sue.

So, not in this reduced form, he says he's immune to attacks, but then that attacks won't have a great effect (meaning they do have some effect?) Beyond the concepts of time, life, and death... Really? Do you really even know what that means? Also, the fact that this is so short compared to the original description, which is described as "In short", is crazy. Anyway, who is Error500? And why did they need to make this particular example? Also, this is literally just the same as the omni-invulnerability from before, except that this one has philosophical klunk which it says doesn't even apply to him anyway.

>High-Flawless Transcendent Beyond Complate Arsenal  
>  
>I have every ability that Exists, Does Not Exist, Everything you can think of, abilities and powers that we haven't thought of yet, abilities and powers we can't comprehend, abilities and powers that will never exist, Every single Power and Ability you can possibly and impossibly think of, Everything you can't think, Any fictional character's abilities any OC's abilities etc. I have everyone's skills. For example, I have everyone's Omnipotent and Omni-Variation (All forms of Omnipotence), these mix to give me an upper hand. I have not only abilities;forms, looks, tactics, in short, I have their everything. I can instantly use and combine any number of them, often flooding his opponents with overwhelming torrents of highly efficient combinations and beyond. Possess all powers/abilities with absolutely no limitation as I'm fundamentally Omnipotent already and beyond.

So what this is saying is that he is omnipotent but in a more "discrete" manner. Also, I've seen "Omni-Variation (all forms of Omnipotence)" before.

Also, given that he has every possible appearance ever (And he's omnipresent and fundamentally incorporeal), why does he have a "canon" appearance? I'm imagining him as a human now. Nobody's gonna stop me, it's right in the abilities!

>GODLY Over Transcendent True Absolute Beyond High Narrative-King Omnidimensional Flawless Authority  
>  
>King Godverse authority is the highest and high any god known possible in every type of verse.(Universe, Multiverse, Omniverse,Chronoverse, Outerverse, Metaverse, Xenoverse, Hyperverse, Megaverse, And Allverse.) and he's Embodiment of Authority. King Godverse has all the powers of the creators over fiction, sometimes it can be at a high level. King Godverse has also an authority that is almost equal to a author itself. He is now equal to an avatar.

I'm waiting for someone to make a rap song out of "Universe Multiverse Omniverse Chronoverse Outerverse Metaverse Xenoverse Hyperverse". That's the only thing all this spam is good for anyway. So, he is... equal to an avatar? An avatar of what? Himself? If you mean self-inserts, not all self-inserts have this "GODLY Over Transcendent etc Authority". JW, my self-insert, hardly has authority over his own left foot! (Fun fact, JW's low power level invalidates every classic Godverse character, as it is not allowed for them to be stronger than 'avatars'. And if the Annoying Dog counts as an avatar (as it says), JW does too.

>True Boundless-God Flawless Transcendent Omnivastanced Omni-Eternal Existence  
>  
>King Godverse possessing no end as well as no beginning. He were never created by anything and will never be concluded existing in all points of time. He pretends to be if he wants to, but his existence was and exists forever. King Godverse is truly timeless, immune to life and death, immeasurable to everything, destruction and erasure, and time, ultimately free from reality and concepts. King Godverse is endlessnes and beginningless. Because it is omnivastanced, he has an Omni-Eternal that beyond the Omnipotent.

So, this whole "eternal existence" thing implies a more fundamental nature of consciousness being part of the universe, as opposed to life's hacked-together version of consciousness that we have. Entropy aside, this actually seems reasonable.

&#x200B;

>True Transcendent Omnivastanced Change Inducement  
>  
>King Godverse can change anything he wants without limits, no matter what. He can make a god out of a worm, completely change the fabrics of reality, and do anything you can think or not.

The only interesting thing I have to comment here is the "making god out of a worm" bit. In my case, for something to be a god, a concept needs to have or have had in the past, a god-like treatment by any group of people. With gods as concepts, all gods are real. So assuming my interpretation is used here, wouldn't manipulating the customs of a large group of people be a more direct description? If not, use another word like... Oh hey, there's that word "godity" that I don't know what it means!

>True Boundless-God Flawless Transcendent Metapotence  
>  
>I can create any spouse without limits. I can do whatever he chooses to do. I am a master at using metapotence.

Here's where I began to wonder if the author knew what they were talking about. As you can see, it says, "I can create any spouse without limits". It has said this since the ability was added to the list (with the exception of the change to first person).'Spouse', if you don't know, is a term to refer to the person someone is married to. I mean, sure, that is technically a part of omnipotence (and after a quick google search, yes, metapotence as well) but that being the one example seems a little... off. My best guess is that 'spouse' was meant to be some other word.But, about the ability itself, metapotence is... literally just omnipotence, I do not understand why they need a separate word for it.

So, now we go into a string of various other omnipotence subcategories:

>True Boundless-God Flawless Transcendent Impossipotence  
>  
>King Godverse has an inaccessible, impossible power, so his every skill works correctly only on him.

So he's not omnipotent? Since his skills only work on him, and NOT anyone else?Also, I don't know what this "impossible" is doing, but I'm pretty sure it needs an "otherwise".

&#x200B;

>True Boundless-God Flawless Transcendent Autopotence  
>  
>King Godverse himself is literally Omnipotent on himself, as you might think. He can elevate his perfection by separating himself from imperfections, he has no limits for himself in any matter, he can easily override laws and logic for himself, he chooses for himself how anything that touches or affects him will affect him, like an author on himself, structure, origin can check or rewrite them all, including, result, and more, and many more very easily.

"Overriding logic"... Nope, can't do that. You can't try to hide from me. ***I will find you, KGV. I will find all overpowered characters. And I will use logic.***

&#x200B;

>True Boundless-God Flawless Transcendent Ultipotence  
>  
>King Godverse has absolute unlimited power and potency. He can obtain everything in an unlimited way, and with it, it has unlimited options and possibilities.

So... this just seems like yet another way saying omnipotence?

>True Boundless-God Flawless Transcendent Elementumpotence  
>  
>Being an all-powerful being He has the power to manipulate omni-elements of the verses. He can shape and manipulate all the elements, be them artificial, natural, supernatural, psychical, physical, esoteric, fantasy, cosmic, universal, divine/transcendent, demonic, conceptual, metaphysical, primordial, etc.

So... assumptions! I'm going to talk about assumptions now. A lot of powers tend to make assumptions about the nature of the universe. I.e. here, that "supernatural, psychical, physical, esoteric, fantasy" etc elements necessarily exist, or heck, if we're in a multiverse, that any given universe can even form elements, let alone omni-elements (whatever that means). We'll see quite a few more of these later.

&#x200B;

>True Boundless-God Flawless Transcendent Arcanepotance  
>  
>King Godverse is unequivocally Omnipotent in anything that adheres to or adheres to any esoteric, mystical, magical and supernatural concept and he has every magic in Omnipotence levels.

Um... yes... he's omnipotent... And like, I know Undertale does this as well and I dislike it. But like, why use "magic" as a term for an established mechanic in a setting? Or "supernatural"? Sure, "magic" tends to not fit in with the established model of the universe, but that's the same with gravity in our world, and even then that only applies where the rest of the universe DOES operate on real world laws. Which, given the way SOULs work in Undertale, might not even apply.

>True Boundless-God Flawless Transcendent Omniarch  
>  
>King Godverse ruler and owner of all over anything and everything in existence or nonexistence. He has absolute control over all objects and entitys, He rules absolutely everything. He rules over anything and everything in existence; as such, He has absolute control over all objects, planes of existences, and life forms, as well as their wills and mindsets (whether they are aware of being controlled or not).

Exists or doesn't exist. Why do people need to clarify this? If it doesn't exist, it \*doesn't exist.\* It doesn't need to be referenced in an ability. And the most blatant repetition. "He rules everything. He rules everything." Also, vague terms like 'ruler' and 'owner' shouldn't be used here, the more direct (though still ambiguous) 'control' alone should adequately describe the ability.

>True Boundless-God Flawless Transcendent Omnilock  
>  
>King Godverse exists in a higher plane of existence and resides outside of everything. So he's immune to so many things like;temporal paradox,reality warping and virtually everything, This is just Omnilock's advantages, he's already *immune*. King Godverse cannot be completely attached to any dimension in any way because he is outside of everything and he exists beyond complete infinity, It is divine. And also King Godverse is completely immune to the lower dimensions. King Godverse is simply immune to anything and everything. King Godverse exist outside the concepts of time, space, life, and death, and that He is not bound by the laws of the Universe itself. He is unkillable and any form of killing Him (physically, mentally, and spiritually) are all impossible. King Godverse resides outside of everything: space, time, non-space, non-time, duality, probability, improbability, possibility, impossibility, totality, non-totality, sence, nonexistence, (absolute) nothingness, existence, and etc. He cannot be affected by anything, even temporal paradox or reality warping; and are immune to virtually everything.

OK, what does 'higher plane of existence' mean? I know that it's a pretty common concept, and 'plane of existence' is an established concept, buta) isn't that established concept already covered by AUs? Literally, In D&D the Feywild is an AU of the usual reality.b) What causes one to be 'higher'?c) How does this make him immune to things?d) He cannot reside outside of everything as 'everything' includes him.

>True Boundless-God Flawless Transcendent Omni-Defiance  
>  
>King Godverse can reach the limits of the infinite emptiness of invincibility by ignoring everything as if it didn't exist. For example, King Godverse can ignore someone's power as if it didn't exist. Even omnipotence can be ignored. This was just an example, the options are endless.

So, this is just Omni-BYPASSING then. Also, 'omnipotence can be ignored'. The misconceptions about omnipotence will NEVER SHUCK END, will they. Also, what says invincibility is an 'emptiness'? Also, 'trying to limit him' doesn't work in Omni-Immunity, but here it says there is a limit? Be consistent.

And here is the worst passive ability one could possibly have. How can you do anything or respond to any situation if you automatically ignore everything? Concept: all other abilities are theoretical and practically nullified by this one making him unable to do stuff.And I've seen this big list of alternates (not this specific one, but the one where it lists off a bunch of jargon with commas or slashes between them in general) a lot. Can anyone tell me what the point of it is? What is the point of saying "creator/destroyer/god/transcendent/OP/powerful/godity/..." when you can just say extremely powerful?

>True Boundless-God Transcendent Omni-Creator and Omni-Destroyer

>King Godverse is the Omnipotent Creator and Destroyer of allverses and the Omnipotence ruler of all. King Godverse exists in any dimension at any time and he is Omnidimensional.

Speak of the devil! He's the creator/destroyer/god/transcendent! I so wanna make a joke about the use of 'dimension' in fantasy vs geometry but it would probably evolve into a tangent about the glorious beauty of the 24-cell so I'm not going to.

Anyway, I once tried creating a "creator and destroyer" character like this, which evolved eventually into Dimensionals, which are basically conscious universes or multiple sets of universes.

And what the heck's an allverse? Isn't that just an omniverse? If so why are there multiple? Isn't "omniverse" meant to represent all possible universes?Also, this isn't true boundless god flawless. It's only true boundless god. I wondered if this had some sort of meaning initially, but now I personally believe it's just a mistake. Whoever added "flawless" to everything just skipped over this.

>King Godverse can induce anything;He can induce any physical, mental, spiritual, supernatural, metaphysical, conceptual, magical, transcendental things. And it all depends on him, if he wants to do things that no one has ever imagined or thought about before, he can do it easily.

Hold on, lemme see... I swear I've seen this ability on another character. Which, well, multiple characters having the same ability is a good thing. PLEASE DO THIS. PLEASE DO THIS. DO IT. However, I can't actually seem to find the character this is taken from. Another list of alternative words, by the way, and another time I randomly think "why is it always conscious being with these OP powers?"

>King Godverse has absolute control over Science, Magic, Divinity and Philosophy as one single united force. King Godverse has the ability to use the combined forces of science, magic, divinity and philosophy, giving King Godverse potentially unlimited power over the four concepts.

With how powerful this character is, I'd rather this just be generalized to conceptually designed powers. Magic has no definition, neither does divinity. And why those four specific things? Doesn't he already have like, 3 different forms of omnipotence?

>TOTALITY OMNI-PERFECTION/FLAWLESS  
>  
>King Godverse is more perfect and flawless than anyone else in everything. Physical, mental, emotional, existential, environmental, intellectual, etc. He's far beyond our understanding.

Perfection is... Well, perfect in what aspect? A cube with a small nick in it isn't a perfect cube, but it is a perfect cube with a small nick in it. Alphard is perfect, if you define perfection relative to being Alphard. Thus, this ability doesn't really mean anything.

He can affect any fictional continuity on an transfictional omnipotent level with no limits.

Another "True Boundless God" that's missing its "Flawless". Also, here is the next assumption - that of the narrative. This is something I've seen three times now, where an AU assumes that all universes have some kind of basic narrative that drives the whole thing. News flash: most don't, unless your idea of a "narrative" is very vague.

There's a lot of things to unpack here.I'll try to provide one sentence for each sub-ability.BTI: Another 'impossible' missing its 'otherwise'.DEM: That isn't a King Godverse ability, that's an authorship ability.KH: Isn't this just part of Omni-BYPASSING?PA: What does 'safe' mean?BD: This statement has no relation in to King Godverse, and is actually a command to the reader.NC: Who the shuck is AA?NPATPD: That 'literally' is sus.NS: Don't work on the he? Reverse "King Godverse -> I" filter.WOG: So what if he says something contradictory?AP: Ah, let's put the most generic creator ability in with all this "narrative" bullklunk.DOTW: Are there multiple King Godverses? But only one Mighty Scepter?

>"Flawless Over Superior Supreme Every Power, Ability and Everything of All Ever"

>King Godverse is by far the superior of all powers. It has all kinds of power and it is the embodiment of power, He can mix every ability at the same time, You may not even be aware that you are dead because speed exceeds infinite. Its power is so immense that it cannot be conceptualized and explained. It can shape power by controlling the laws and limits of power. Every time a character is thought, created or destroyed, I will be beyond conceptualized with all the possibilities and possibilities. Like King Godverse's power, his abilities are by far the highest in Godverse. His talent always transcends the infinite understanding of the gods and breaks eternity. He is superior to God, and he surpasses every ability by far. Others' abilities are toys for him. He has all of the powers, all that you can think of, all that you can't think of, all that everyone can think of, and all that everyone can't think of,and beyond. and all of it's powers are undeniably stronger than any OC. Everything and anything. Anything of \[LA powerlisting\] and etc. He has any \[LA: long named abilities\] etc. This is allow him manipulate any power, every character that's about to be made, been created, not being created, existing characters, non existing characters, characters that're not in any wiki, every power that everyone dreams, every power and abilities that everyone gives to their characters by thinking about, abilities and powers that are not yet created or given, unimaginable or considered abilities and powers and etc. He can use anyone. I have \[LA: possible or impossible\], etc. power/ability ever. Besides, when any OC is produced, it becomes stronger by copying all of them at a time higher than thought, so that whoever newly created cannot defeat it, this makes sense, as he has everything of any OC/God. He's beyond all and ahead of everyone and all of it's powers are undeniably stronger than anyone. Anything he exceeds will not affect him, and whatever fiction is to us will be fiction to him, he sees them as fiction.

Every time there's \[LA\] in there, that's a huge list of alternates that I skipped to reduce the length of this word salad. "LA" stands for "list of alternates", and is what I'll be using for those big lists of words going forwards. So, starting off, I... swear this ability has been seen before. Ah yes, the "fiction to him" part from Omnivastance. But other than that, I swear I saw the "mix every ability" bit as well. Maybe I'm just remembering from my previous KGV post.Also, seriously? "Possibilities and possibilities"? They ain't even trying now.

>"Flawless Over Superior Supreme Transcendent Every Power of Gods, Anyone and (Some)Creators Ever"  
>  
>~~Did you seriously think I was standing in a confined space? Hahaha..~~King Godverse is known to have the powers of every god, but it's more than that. King Godverse actually puppets every god, and he is controlling all of them with his eyes at every conceptional time, and yes he is the one who makes them do almost every move. He has superior versions of the abilities of all of them. King Godverse has managed to kill a lot of creators just like Infected, he has the same abilities as the creators. He's beyond all and ahead of everyone.

>\*\*King Creator Mode:\*\*King Godverse can act so absolut- ~~Did you think I'd be exposed? I will be author for myself.~~

What's with the "(some) creators"? Was the author too much of a wuss to give KGV power over all of us? And what's with the weird struck out dialogue? is this KGV talking? Why is he interrupting this which is WRITTEN FROM FIRST PERSON ANYWAY? And what's with the confined space? Also, time for another assumption! Well, not an assumption, but a way that this KGV character conflicts with... everything. Simply put, in most mulitverse settings, not every god is a puppet of KGV.

>"Beyond Superior Supreme Any True Impossible Ever"  
>  
>The concept of the impossible doesn't even exist for him. He can break everything of the impossibility and do everything impossible by realizing the greatest impossibilities in the realm of the impossibility.

You mean otherwise impossible?Bruh, learn the lesson already. You literally said he doesn't acknowledge the concept of impossible.

>No matter how much you oppose... my supreme power beyond eternity. \[THE GRAND-DADDY OF ALL LISTS OF ALTERNATES, HAVING 600 WORDS OF VARIOUS RANDOM AHH THINGS AND POWERSCALING JARGON, WITH EVEN A FEW PRONOUNS THROWN IN TO ROUND THINGS OFF\] This grants me unlimited power, knowledge, and control. I'm in everything that you can't think or not. If a creator or character himself tries to surpass me, I will instantly notice this and instantly surpass the character. I can do whatever I want I am the one who's above all. Anything he exceeds will not affect him, and whatever fiction is to us will be fiction to him, he sees them as fiction.

So... yeah, As you read, in the original page for this ability, there is a 600-word-long LA of... just... nonsense. Here's a tiny sample of it:

>inclusive, elements, descriptions, define, explain, express, attempt, theorize, thoughts, nothingness, all dimensions, sub-dimensions, non-dimensions, designs, end of everything, below everything, opposite, pieces, modern, beyond all time, surpasses, arguments, claims, rules, paragraphs, simple, complex, complicated, defines, normal, hard, difficult, good, evil, words, non-narratives, narratives, forms, life forms, decomposed, versions, documented, costs, various, reverse, worlds, verses, absolute counter, omin-counter, neutral, lawful, chaotic, intelligence, abilities, tiers, durability, stalemate, losses, defeat, victory, soloing, roflstomp, forced, bio, reasonable, unreasonable, stomp, easy, normal, hard, difficult

Who... Just... who? How? WHY? This is less than 1/6 of the whole thing. Who would write something like this!? Some of the klunk is just copy-pasted! And... roflstomp? I won't get mad at you for a 'dead' meme, but... rofl. Why would you write something like this? Honestly, HOW would you write something like this? I'm gonna make a random generator that just pulls random words from THIS monstrosity of an LA.

>Besides being everything else, I am also completely different from everything else.

Luckily this one is rather short and sweet. Just casually mention that you are everything else. Okay, gotcha. More abilities need to be casually and concisely explained like this, maybe with less blatant contradictions.

>"Incomprehensible"

>Mentioning King Godverse in a Page to compare power immediately makes the character KG's puppet and KG steals all abilities, powers, capabilities and **everything** of it untill it becomes omega low hypoversal-------------------------------------------- level or less, King Godverse will have infinitely more powerfull abilities than it and it will amplify his power to uncountible levels. If someone critical does that, KG will intervene immediately, but if he doesn't care too much or it does someone nice for KG, KG doesn't care or makes him a leisure puppet. His abilities are permanently his and can't be taken, duplicated, erased, removed, transcended, bypassed, Stopped, Used, Etc.

So, that is not how that works. "King Godverse's power level is GDICT, similar to SCUDA's power level". "SCUDA's power level is still GDICT". Did you notice how there was no reference of omega low hypoversal------------------------------------------ power level? What does "hypoversal" mean even? And, I didn't abbreviate this LA because it's... familiar. Also... "King Godverse is GDICT, just like King Godverse". What happens now, huh? Does King Godverse drain his own power? Also, passive ability.Hypothesis: One can have too many puppets.

From 4th Breaker Z Sans:

>His abilities are permanently his and can't be taken, duplicated, erased, removed, transcended, bypassed, Stopped, Used, Etc.

Sharing abilities poggers!!!!! It's a good thing, but I just noticed it and something I wanted to point out.

>"Flawless Transcendent Consumer of Everything, Everyone, Anything, Anyone and Nothing Ever"

>Yes, I can absorb everything, whether I want it or not. Every place I go, every place I go, every mind I go, every time I go, every truth and reality I go to, everything that touches me, everything that affects me, everything that hits me, everything that is done to me, every force used against me, thoughts, agreements, knowledge, what they know, I can absorb every weakness that goes against me, every weak being that tries to attack me, and anything that you can't think of. I consume everything.

I'm going to use a non-Glader swear word here, but... Can we please ***fuck off*** with the passive abilities!? I'm starting to get kind of mad! They don't make you more powerful to be passive, they're just inconvenient annoyances. Plus, this is in direct conflict with his supposed omnipotence! If he doesn't want to do this, he should be able to not do it out of nigh-omnipotence.

>"Superior Transcendent Power of Everyone Ever"  
>  
>King Godverse has infinitely superior powers of all entitys' powers. These same forces combine to become King Godverse's special power, thus making King Godverse a true king. That's why King Godverse is unrivaled. King Godverse especially since he take all newly created beings powers, none of the new beings can defeat King Godverse. King Godverse achieves superior powers/everything for himself by mixing them all in a time that is more conceptualized than ever. No one new/god can beat him. He will be beyond true beyond infinity everyone and always. Everytime an power, OC, Character created, I'll become ∞∞∞∞∞++++(and beyond)stronger than and superior with all possibilities. I am the one who's above all.

"But RSS Sans has Omni-BYPASSING-BYPASSING and can be stronger than King Godverse!" This is the kind of argument that leads to abilities like this, pretty much shutting off every way for anyone to be stronger from a meta standpoint rather than the perspective of the actual logic of the abilities. And ∞∞∞∞∞++++ = ∞? Why have  ∞∞∞∞∞? What's the difference between five infinities and six infinities? Are we in Reality 5 right now as opposed to reality 6?

>"Flawless Over True Puppetmaster"  
>  
>King Godverse is actually one of the best Puppetmasters in Godverse. He can make anyone puppet if he wants, but he usually gets along well with his people, so he doesn't do it when he has to. He often uses his servants when they don't do what King Godverse wanted. Since he is a puppetmaster, he has strings similar to CC's strings. He can control Godverse and anyone in fiction on an High-Omni-Transcient∞ level.

But didn't it say he automatically does it when people compare power levels? Be consistent, bruh. Who is CC again? And why does being puppetmaster imply having strings? I get he has them in general because omnipotence, but "puppetmaster" does not imply literal puppets!

Anyway, that is the end of TBGF1 remastered... part 1. Yup, we've only covered HALF of KGV's abilities so far. And I'm already worrying that this post is getting too long, so there will be another post dedicated to the other half.
